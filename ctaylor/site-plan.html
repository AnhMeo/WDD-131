       <h4> Introduction</h4>
        <p>Hi, my name is Christian Taylor. Welcome to my page. I created this page so that I could share my story with you. This is my space to share where I’m from, who I’ve become, what I’ve achieved, what my passions are, and what my ambitions for the future look like. While my resume could sum up a few of those details elegantly and succinctly, this website will go beyond the surface-level information of the resume, and allow you to really get to know me. </p>

<h5>Let's start with my background. </h5>

<h4>Family background</h4>
<p>“Where are you from?” It seems like a simple question. When asked, you might expect a simple answer. For me, however, the answer is not so simple. I was born on May 15th, 1999 in Ogden, Utah (USA). Due to the decisions of my birth parents, I only lived with them for a month before I was dropped off for babysitting at my uncle and aunt’s home. This moment changed everything. My biological parents never came back. In an instant, my newlywed uncle and aunt who had only been married for two months became my parents. To consider them anything less would be ignorant, but this doesn't fully answer the question of where I'm from. You'll need to know who my parents are to understand the environment I was raised in. My Dad is the fifth of seven children. At the time, he was attending Weber State University. My Mom, an only child, was a Vietnamese student studying abroad in the US at Weber State, which is where they met. They fell in love in math class, and the rest is history. A year later, we welcomed my sister to the world.</p>

<h4>Dad</h4>
<p>To take care of my family's needs, my Dad decided to serve in the military. The lifestyle of a military family took the four of us all over. We've lived in Utah, Connecticut, Washington (state), Virginia, Hawaii, Vietnam, and Japan. Growing up in so many different places is part of what complicates my answer to the “where are you from” question, but it is important for explaining the exposure that I had to many different cultures and experiences. The diversity was beautiful and fascinating to me, and having to move around so often gave me the ability to adapt to whatever situation or environment I was in. </p>

<h4>Mom</h4>
<p>My Mom decided to stay home and take care of my sister and me. This decision created a level of consistency for us. No matter where we lived, Mom was always there when we came home from school. She is a master caregiver, and she created an environment where my sister and I were immersed in the Vietnamese language and culture. Having this environment has shaped a huge part of my identity. I am proud to be a Vietnamese-American, and I am honored to be able to share this heritage with my son. My Mom gave us structure. She enforced high academic standards and encouraged us to pursue extracurriculars such as music and sports. </p>

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>For me, this started with the piano. I have been playing for nearly my whole life, and I am so grateful for the opportunity. It has allowed me to perform for government officials and in international competitions. It has created opportunities to share this love with others as a piano teacher. Most importantly, it has given me a productive outlet to help me handle stress and other difficult emotions, and my love for piano has developed into a passion for music itself.</p>

<h4>Language </h4>
<p>With my native bilingualism as a baseline, I became very interested in foreign languages as well. Living abroad and being around people from all over allowed me to develop varying levels of proficiency in languages such as Japanese. I’ve been able to use my skills to provide language services as a professional interpreter, which allowed me to eliminate language barriers so people could have access to essential services. Growing up, I realized that many of my fellow Vietnamese-Americans yearned for a connection to their Vietnamese language and culture, but for one reason or another they were not able to develop that link, or at least not to the extent that they wanted to. When I was 20 years old I decided to start a project that would try to make a difference for them. I created my own curriculum from scratch and opened a free online Vietnamese class that I taught every week. My love of language continues to open doors for me to serve others, and I hope to continue to do so. </p>

<h4>Technology </h4>
<p>Another passion of mine is technology. As a teenager, I had the opportunity to attend a two-week residential STEM institute in Maryland where I led a research group focused on computer programming. This moment turned a hobby of mine into a passion, and set me on a path that I am still on today as I pursue my degree in Cybersecurity. It has been amazing to see how my skills with language have carried over to skills related to my major. Coding and programming are, after all, language skills which require knowledge of vocabulary and syntax. I love the challenge and thrill of finding solutions to new problems, and this field satisfies that desire for me. </p>

      <h4>"...by their fruits ye shall know them" -Matthew 7:20</h4>

        I believe that a good way to get to know someone is by examining their work. As you go through the projects I have listed here, I hope that you will get a feel for the thought that goes into my  work and the level of quality that I hold myself to.
